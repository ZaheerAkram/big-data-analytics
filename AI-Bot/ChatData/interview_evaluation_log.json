There are several types of regularization, including:\n\n* L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which add a penalty term to the coefficients of the model, encouraging simpler models and reducing overfitting.\n\n* Dropout regularization, which randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron.\n\n* Early stopping, which stops training when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing overfitting.\n\nIn general, the choice of regularization technique depends on the specific problem and data characteristics."

To prevent overfitting, we can use regularization techniques such as L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, or increasing the size of the training dataset."

Specifically, L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization add the absolute and squared values of the weights, respectively, to the loss function. Dropout regularization randomly sets a portion of the neurons to zero during training, reducing overfitting. Early stopping is not a type of regularization, but rather a technique that stops training when the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade."
